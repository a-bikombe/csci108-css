                <h3>Dreams</h3>
                <p>by Langston Hughes</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Hold fast to dreams </p>
                        <p>For if dreams die</p>
                        <p>Life is a broken-winged bird</p>
                        <p>That cannot fly.</p>
                            <br>
                        <p>Hold fast to dreams</p>
                        <p>For when dreams go</p>
                        <p>Life is a barren field</p>
                        <p>Frozen with snow.
                    </p>
